## About me:
Hello! I am a Dota 2 player. My persistence, endurance and large library of knowledge over a long period of time allowed me to reach the highest division in this game. I have always been attracted to games and the IT sphere. Currently, I work as a junior system administrator in one company. I want to further develop in this field and learn new technologies, making the same efforts as in games!
